    <h3 id="how-it-works">Creating a Subscription</h3>
    <p>Welcome to our Bookshelf Box subscription service!</p>
    <p>Here's how it works:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Create a subscription option by deciding whether you want a one-off box or a recurring subscription (monthly
            or every 3 months).</li>
        <li>Choose how many books you would like in your box (1, 2, or 3 books).</li>
        <li>Create your subscription and proceed to make the payment.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The price of your subscription is based on the category of books you choose and the number of books you select.
        You will also receive a discount depending on the type of subscription you choose.</p>

    <h3 id="subscription-plans">Subscription Plans</h3>
    <p>Here are the available categories and their prices per book:</p>
