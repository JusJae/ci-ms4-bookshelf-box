### User Stories

1.	#### Account Management:

	•	As a registered user, I want to log in to the application so that I can manage my product list.
	•	As a registered user, I want to reset my password in case I forget it.
2.	#### Product Management:
	•	As a user, I want to add a new product to my list, including its image, so that I can keep track of my products.
	•	As a user, I want to view all my products in a list or grid view so that I can easily navigate through them.
	•	As a user, I want to update the details of a product, including changing its image, to keep my product information current.
	•	As a user, I want to delete a product from my list when I no longer need it.
3.	#### Search and Filter:
	•	As a user, I want to search for a product by its name to quickly find specific products.

	•	As a user, I want a navigation menu to quickly move between different sections of the application.

8.	#### Error Handling and Feedback:
	•	As a user, I want to receive clear error messages when something goes wrong so that I understand what happened and how to proceed.

In addition to not having originally planned to have a custom 404 page but adding it in during the project.
